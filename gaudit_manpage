NAME
    gaudit - a small proof of conept utility for VM security scanning

SYNOPSIS
    gaudit { -c | -r | -d } [OPTION] | { -v | -h }

DESCRIPTION
    Perform security audit functions on virtual domains from the hypervisor 
    level, or dom0 in the case of Xen, when running in an environment that 
    uses libvirt by utilitizing the libguestfs utilities.

    -c
        configuration file (if not using the default)
    
    -r [id]     
        run report of audit specified by [id]
            Note: This will not run an audit, but only generate a report
    
    -l
        list report ids available along with domain options and timestamps

    -d [dom1,dom2]  
        virtual domain(s), comma separated: guest1,guest2
            Note: Default is to run against all active virtual domains for
            audits, but this field is *required* for report generation
        
    -v  
        verbose messages during audit report gathering

    -h  
        print this help prompt and exit

EXAMPLES
    The following will run an audit on all currently active virtual domains in 
    libvirt that contain the libguestfs live configurations, with verbose output
        
        gaudit -v

    The following will run the same audit as above but only on virtual domains
    'guest1' and 'guest2' also with verbose output

        gaudit -d guest1,guest2 -v

    This will generate a report with audit id 1234 and include verbose output 
    as well as print a summary at the conclusion of the generation

        gaudit -r 1234 -v
